       NaN stands for Not a Number. NaN is what you get when you try to
       perform impossible mathematical operations or when you try to perform
       mathematical operations with strings.
      */
      //Examples of operations that return NaN
      //1. Math Operations where the result is not a real number.
      //For example: Calculating the square root of a negatoive number.
      console.log(Math.sqrt(-1));

      //Attempting any math operation involving a string other than with the addition operator.
      console.log("yarn" / "book");

      //Attempting to convert a string to a number.
      console.log(parseInt("Freddy"));
