      /*The most commonly used array functions.

        concat() A new array made up of the current array, joined with other arrays
        and/or values
        every() True if every element in the given array satisfies the provided testing
        function
        filter() A new array with all the elements of a current array that test true by the
        given function
        forEach() Completes the function once for each element in the array
        includes() Determines whether an array includes a specified value and returns
        true or false
        indexOf() Finds the first occurrence of the specified value within the array; returns
        –1 if the value is not found
        join() Joins all elements of an array into a string
        lastIndexOf() Finds the last occurrence of the specified value within the array; returns
        –1 if the value is not found
        map() Creates a new array with the result of a provided function on every
        element in the array
        pop() Removes the last element in an array
        push() Adds new items to the end of an array
        reduce() Reduces the values in an array to a single value by applying a function
        to them (from left to right)
        reverse() Reverses the order of elements in an array
        shift() Removes the first element from an array and returns that element,
        resulting in a change in length of an array
        slice() Selects a portion of an array and returns it as a new array
        Method Return Value
        some() Returns true if one or more elements satisfy the provided testing
        function
        sort() Creates a new array by sorting the elements in an array
        splice() Returns a new array composed of elements that were added or
        removed from a given array
        toString() Converts an array to a string
        unshift() Returns a new array with a new length by the addition of one or more
        elements
