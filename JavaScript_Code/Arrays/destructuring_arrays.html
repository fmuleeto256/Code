      /*Destructuring in JavaScript is a concise way to extract values from arrays or
      objects and assign them to variables.
      When applied to arrays, it's referred to as "array destructuring.
      */
      const [variable1, variable2, variable3, variableN] = array;

      //Example.
      const fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];

      const [firstFruit, secondFruit, thirdFruit] = fruits;

      console.log(firstFruit); // Output: 'apple'
      console.log(secondFruit); // Output: 'banana'
      console.log(thirdFruit); // Output: 'orange'
      /*
        Key Points:
        Declaration: The left-hand side of the assignment (const [variable1, variable2, ..., variableN])
        declares variables that will hold the corresponding values from the array.

        Order Matters: The order of variables on the left corresponds to the order of elements in the
        array.
        The first variable gets the value of the first element, the second variable gets the value of
        the second element, and so on.

        Skipping Elements: You can skip elements you're not interested in by leaving an empty space
        (const [first, , third] = array;).

        Rest Operator (...): You can use the rest operator to collect the remaining elements into a
        new array.

      console.log(firstColor); // Output: 'red'
