      /*Comparisons
        We know many comparison operators from maths.

        In JavaScript they are written like this:

        Greater/less than: a > b, a < b.
        Greater/less than or equals: a >= b, a <= b.
        Equals: a == b, please note the double equality sign == means the equality test, while a single one a = b means an assignment.
        Not equals: In maths the notation is ≠, but in JavaScript it’s written as a != b.
        In this article we’ll learn more about different types of comparisons, how JavaScript makes them, including important peculiarities.

        At the end you’ll find a good recipe to avoid “JavaScript quirks”-related issues.
        */

      /*Boolean is the result:
        All comparison operators return a boolean value. 
        true: This means yes/correct/the truth.
        false: This means no/not correct/ wrong/ not the truth.
        For example:
        */
       2 > 1 // true
       2 == 1 // false
       2 < 1 // false
       2 != 1 // correct

       //A comparison result can be assigned to a variable just like any value. 

       let result = 5 > 4;
       alert(result);
