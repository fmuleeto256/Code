        To see whether a string is greater than the other, JS uses the dictionary order.
        Strings are compared letter by letter. 
        For example:
        */
       alert("A" > "B"); // "A" is not greater than "B" // False
       alert("Fred" > "John"); //J comes before F //False.
       alert("Glow" > "Glee");  // In this case, the first two letters of each word are 
       //the same, so, we move on to the 3rd letters. O is greater than e, so Glow is greater.

       /*Note: A letter that comes last in the alphabet is greater than a letter that comes first.
       */
      
       /*Note: The comparison of strings looks like the same as that of a dictionary, but
       it is not exactly the same.
        Uppercase letter "A" and lowercase letter "a" are not exactly the same.
        Lowercase letter "a" has a higher index in the JS enconding table(unicode), so
        it is greater than uppercase letter "A".
