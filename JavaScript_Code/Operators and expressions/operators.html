      //Expressions. An expression is a piece of code that evaluates to a value.
      //Such as
      x = 4;
      x = x + 1;
      // Operators
      //In JavaScript, operators are special symbols or keywords that perform operations
      // on operands/ values.
      //Operator precedence.
      x = 5 - 1 / 2;
      /*
        The key to understanding statements with multiple operators is operator
        precedence. Operator precedence assigns a number from 1 to 19 to each
        operator. In a statement containing multiple operators, the operator with
        the highest number runs first.
      */
      // For example / and * operators have a higher precedence than - and +
      // We can use the grouping operator () to control which expression runs first.
      //It has the highest precedence of all operators.
      //For example, in the following statement, the division and multiplication
      //would normally happen first:
      x = 4 - 5 - (2 / 2) * 2;
      /*If you wanted the left and right sides of the division operator to run
        before the division is done, you could use the grouping operator like
        this:
        */
      x = (4 - 5 - 2) / (2 * 2);
      //The result of this statement is -3 / 4, or -.75.

      //Assignment operators.
      //The assignment operator assigns a value to the operand on the left based
      //on the operand on the right:
      x = 10;
      //You can also chain together assignment operators. For example:
      x = y = z = 0;
      /*Remember that the associativity of the assignment operator is from right
        to left. So, the way JavaScript executes this expression is by assigning 0
        to z, and then the value of z to y, and then the value of y to x. In the end,
        all three variables are 0.
      */
      /*Comparison operators:
        The comparison operators test for equality of the left and right operands,
        and return a Boolean (true or false) value.
       */
      //== Equality 3 == “3” // true
      //!= Inequality 3 != 3 // false
      //=== Strict equality 3 === “3” // false
      //!== Strict inequality 3 !== “3” // true
      //> Greater than 7 > 1 // true
      //>= Greater than or equal to 7 >= 7 // true
      //< Less than 7 < 10 // true
      //<= Less than or equal to 2 <= 2 // true

      /* Arithmetic Operators:
       The arithmetic operators perform mathematical operations and return the
        results
        Operator Description Example
        + Addition a = 1 + 1
        – Subtraction a = 10 - 1
        * Multiplication a = 2 * 2
        / Division a = 8 / 2
        % Remainder a = 5 % 2
        ++ Increment
        a = ++b
        a = b++
        a++
        -- Decrement
        a = --b
        a = b--
        a--
        ** Exponentiation operator 2 ** 2
      */
      /*
       Logical operators: 
       These evaluate an expression for truthiness or falsiness.
        (&& AND)Returns true if all values are true and false if one value is false. 
        (|| OR) Returns true if one value is true and false if all are false. 
        (! Not) Returns false if the value is true and true if the value is false.
