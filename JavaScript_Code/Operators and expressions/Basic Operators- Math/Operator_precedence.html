      /*
        If an expression has more than one operator , the execution order is determined
        by the order of their precedence.

        From school, we know that multiplication has a higher precedence than addition

        1+2*2: In this expression, multiplication will be calculated first.

        However, if we want to override the precedence, we should use brackets.
        (1+2)*2
        */

      //Every operator in JavaScipt has a corresponding operator number.

      /*Unary plus +: Precedence 14
        Unary negation -:  Precedence 14
        Exponention **: Precedence 13
        Multiplication * and Division /: Precedence 13
        Addition + and subtraction -: Precedence 11
        Assignment operator =: Precdence 2

        From that, we can see that the assignment operator has a very low precedence.
