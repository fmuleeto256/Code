      /* Terms used.
      1. An operand. This is what operators are applied to.
        In this example, 5*2, 5 and 2 are operands or arguments.

      2. An operator is unary if it has a single operand.
      For example: The unary negation reverses the sign of a number.
      */
      let x = 1;
      x = -1;
      alert(x); //Unary negation was applied.

      /*
       An operator is binary if it has two operands.
       */
      let z = 1,
        y = 3;
      alert(y - z); // 2, binary minus subtracts values

      /*Maths:

       The following math operations are supported:

         Addition +
         Subtraction -
         Multiplication *
         Division /
         Remainder %
         Exponentiation **
         The first four are straightforward, while % and ** need a few words about them.
       */

      /*Remainder %
       We use this to get a remeainder between two numbers.
       */
      alert(5 % 2); // The answer is 1.

      /*Exponention **
       This raises a number to the power of another number.

       */
      alert(2 ** 2); // 2² = 4
      alert(2 ** 3); // 2³ = 8

      /*
       Just like in maths, the exponentiation operator is defined for non-integer 
       numbers as well.
       For example, a square root is an exponentiation by ½:
       */
      alert(4 ** (1 / 2)); // 2 (power of 1/2 is the same as a square root)
      alert(8 ** (1 / 3)); // 2 (power of 1/3 is the same as a cubic root)

      /*String concatenation with binary +

      Usually, the + operator sums numbers. But if the + operator is applied to strings,
      it merges(concatenates them)

      Forexample:
      */

      let s = "Hello" + "World";
      alert(s); // HelloWorld

      //If any of the operands is a string, the other one is converted to a string too

      let w = "10" + 10;
      alert(w); // 1010

      /*The binary + is the only operator that works in such a way.
      Other operators usually change their operands to numbers. 

      Here is an example for subtration and division. 
      */
      alert(6 - "2"); // 4, converts '2' to a number
      alert("6" / "2"); // 3, converts both operands to numbers
