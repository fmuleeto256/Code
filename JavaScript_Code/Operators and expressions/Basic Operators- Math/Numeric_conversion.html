      /*The plus + exists in two forms. 
        1. The binary form
        2. And the unary form. 
        The unary operator + when applied to a single value doesn't do anything to numbers.
        But if the operand is not a number, the unary operator + converts it into a number.
        
        No effect on numbers:
        */
      let x = -1;
      alert(+x); // -1 ( The number is unchanged)

      //Converts non-numbers.

      alert(+true); // 1
      alert(+false); // 0
      alert(+""); // 0

      /*
        It actually does the same thing as Number(...), but is shorter.

        The need to convert strings to numbers arises very often. 
        For example, if we are getting values from HTML form fields, 
        they are usually strings. What if we want to sum them?

        The binary plus would add them as strings:
      */

      let apples = "2";
      let oranges = "3";

      alert(apples + oranges); // "23", the binary plus concatenates strings

      //If we want to treat them as numbers, we need to convert and then sum them:

      // both values converted to numbers before the binary plus
      alert(+apples + +oranges); // 5

      // the longer variant
      // alert( Number(apples) + Number(oranges) ); // 5

      /*
      From a mathematician’s standpoint, the abundance of pluses may seem strange. 
      But from a programmer’s standpoint, there’s nothing special: 
      unary pluses are applied first, they convert strings to numbers, 
      and then the binary plus sums them up.
