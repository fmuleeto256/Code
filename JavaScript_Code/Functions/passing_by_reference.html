      //Passing by reference.
      /*
        What happens: When you pass an object (like an array or an object) to a function, 
        you're actually passing a reference (a way to find it in memory) to the function.
        Effect: Changes made to the object inside the function affect the original object 
        outside the function.
        Example: If you have a recipe book (object) and share it with a friend, both of you
        can make changes to the recipes. If your friend adds a new recipe, it's also in your book because you both are using the same reference (book).

      // Function that takes a cookie jar (passing by reference) with hoisting

        cookies.total = cookies.total + 1; // You added a cookie to the jar!

        "Outside the function: Total cookies in my jar =",
