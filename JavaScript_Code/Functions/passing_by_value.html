      /*
      Passing by Value:
      What happens: When you pass a value (like a number or a string) to a function, a copy of 
      that value is sent to the function.
      Effect: Any changes made to the value inside the function do not affect the original value
       outside the function.
      Example: If you have a cookie (value) and give a friend a piece, you each have your own independent
       pieces. Changing your piece doesn't change your friend's piece.
      */
      // Declare the variable at the top
      let cookieJar = 5;

      // Call the function with the number of cookies before it's defined
      eatCookie(cookieJar);

      // Function that takes a number (passing by value)
      function eatCookie(cookies) {
        cookies = cookies - 1;  // You ate one cookie!
        console.log("Inside the function: Cookies eaten =", cookies);
      }

      // Outside the function, the original number is unchanged
      console.log("Outside the function: Cookies in the jar =", cookieJar);
