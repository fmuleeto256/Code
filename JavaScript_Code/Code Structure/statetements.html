        1. We can have as many statements in our code as we want.
        For example: alert("Hello World")
        2. Statements can be separated by semicolons:
        alert("Hello"); alert("World")

        3. Usually, statements are written on separate lines to make the code
        more readable. 

        alert("Hello");
        alert("World")
