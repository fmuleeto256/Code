      /*It happens in logical operations (later we’ll meet condition tests and other similar things) but can also be performed explicitly with a call to Boolean(value).

        The conversion rule:

        Values that are intuitively “empty”, like 0, an empty string, null, undefined, 
        and NaN, become false.
        Other values become true.
        For instance:
      */
      alert(Boolean(1)); // true
      alert(Boolean(0)); // false

      alert(Boolean("hello")); // true
      alert(Boolean("")); // false
      /*
        Please note: the string with zero "0" is true
        Some languages (namely PHP) treat "0" as false. But in JavaScript, a non-empty 
        string is always true.
