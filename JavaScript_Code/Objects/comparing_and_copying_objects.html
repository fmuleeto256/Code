      /* 1. Objects and Reference vs. Value:
      1.Copying Objects:
      When you make a copy of an object using the assignment operator (=) or by passing
      it into a function, what gets copied is the reference to the object in memory, not
       the values inside the object.
      Unlike primitive data types (strings, numbers), which are copied by value, objects
      are copied by reference.

      */

      /* 2. Object Comparison:
      Triple Equals Operator (===):

      When comparing objects using the === operator, it compares the references, not the values 
      inside the objects. Two objects with identical properties and values are not considered 
      equal because they are different objects in memory.
      */

      const secondObject = { prop1: "test", prop2: "test2" };

      console.log(firstObject === secondObject); // Outputs: false

      /* 3. Copying Objects by Reference:
       When you assign one object to another variable (thirdObject = secondObject), you are not 
       creating a new object but creating a reference to the same object.
      */
      const thirdObject = secondObject;
      thirdObject.prop1 = "orange";
      console.log(secondObject.prop1 === thirdObject.prop1); // Outputs: true

      /*4. Reference Nature of Objects:
       Changes made to an object through one reference affect the other references to the same object.
      */
      thirdObject.prop3 = "claw hammer";
      console.log(secondObject.prop3); // Outputs: claw hammer

      /*5. Shallow Copy of Objects:
        To create a new object that doesn't affect the original, you need to make a shallow copy.
        The spread operator (...) can be used to create a shallow copy of an object.
