        In JavaScript, the this keyword refers to an object.
        The this keyword refers to different objects depending
        on how it is used.
    Note: In an object method, this refers to the object.
        Alone, this refers to the global object.
        In a function, this refers to the global object.
        In a function, in strict mode, this is undefined.
        In an event, this refers to the element that received the event.
        Methods like call(), apply(), and bind() can refer this to any object.
    Note: this is not a variable, it is a keyword, you can't change the variable of this.
