      /*
        In JavaScript, each object has a prototype, which is like a blueprint or template.
         This prototype defines the object's default properties and methods. When you create
          a new object, it inherits properties and methods from its prototype.
        */
      //1.Prototype from Constructor Function:
      /*
      When you create an object using a constructor function, the new object's prototype is 
      set to the constructor function's prototype.
      */
      // Constructor function
      function Vehicle(speed) {
        this.speed = speed;
      }

      // Create an object using the constructor
      const car = new Vehicle(60);

      // The prototype of the 'car' object is 'Vehicle.prototype'
      console.log(Object.getPrototypeOf(car) === Vehicle.prototype); // Outputs: true

      //2. Prototype from Another Object:
      /*
      When you create an object using another object as a prototype, 
      the new object inherits properties and methods from that prototype object.
      */
      // Prototype object
      const vehiclePrototype = {
        move: function () {
          return `Moving at ${this.speed} km/h`;
        },
      };

      // Create an object using 'vehiclePrototype' as the prototype
      const bicycle = Object.create(vehiclePrototype);
      bicycle.speed = 20;

      // 'bicycle' inherits the 'move' method from 'vehiclePrototype'
      console.log(bicycle.move()); // Outputs: Moving at 20 km/h

      //3. Objects Access Properties of Their Parents:
      /*
      Objects can access properties and methods from their prototype (parent). 
      If a property is not found in the object itself, JavaScript looks up the prototype chain.
      */
      // Adding a property to the 'vehiclePrototype'
      vehiclePrototype.numberOfWheels = 4;

      // Accessing the 'numberOfWheels' property from the 'bicycle' object
      console.log(bicycle.numberOfWheels); // Outputs: 4

      //4. Using Own Property vs. Prototype Property:
      /*
      If an object has its own property with the same name as a property in its prototype,
       it uses its own property.
      */
      // Adding an 'engine' property to the 'bicycle' object
      bicycle.engine = "manual";

      // 'bicycle' has its own 'engine' property, not using the prototype's 'engine'
      console.log(bicycle.engine); // Outputs: manual
