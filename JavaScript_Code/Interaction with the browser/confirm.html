        In JavaScript, the confirm function is another method for interacting 
        with users through a dialog box. The confirm function displays a dialog box
         with a message and OK and Cancel buttons. It's commonly used to get a simple 
         "yes" or "no" response from the user.
        */
      let userConfirmed = confirm("Do you want to proceed?");

      if (userConfirmed) {
        alert("You chose to proceed!");
      } else {
        alert("You chose to cancel.");
      }

      /*
      In this example, the confirm function displays a dialog box with the message 
      "Do you want to proceed?" and OK/Cancel buttons. The user's choice is then 
      stored in the userConfirmed variable, and the code proceeds accordingly.
      */

      /*
      It's worth noting that the confirm function returns a Boolean value 
      (true if the user clicks OK, false if the user clicks Cancel), 
      and this value is commonly used in conditional statements to determine
       the flow of the program.
